# Self Driving Car Nano Degree

This repository contains my project submissions for Udacity's self driving car nano degree. 

The Self-Driving Car Engineer is an online certification intended to prepare students to become self-driving car engineers. The program was developed by Udacity in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA, Otto, DiDi, BMW, McLaren and NextEv.

Program Outline:

Term 1: Deep Learning and Computer Vision (Started Jan 2017)

**Deep Learning**

* Project 2: Traffic Sign Classifier (Deep Learning) - Use tensorflow to train a convolution neural network capable of detecting road side traffic signs.
* Project 3: Behavioural Cloning (Deep Learning): Train a car to drive in a 3D simulator using a deep neural network. 
    
**Computer Vision**

* Project 1: Finding Lane Lines (Intro to Computer Vision): Introductory project which used basic computer vision techniques like canny edge and hough transforms to detect lane lines
* Project 4: Advanced Lane Lines (Computer Vision): Use of image thresholding, warping and fitting lanes lines to develop a more robust method of detecting lane lines on a road
* Project 5: Vehicle Detection (Computer Vision): Use of HOG and SVM to detect vehicles on a road

Term 2: Sensor Fusion, Localisation and Control (Started March 2017)

1. Sensor Fusion

- Combining lidar and radar data to track objects in the environment using Kalman filters.
2. Localisation

- Locate a car relative to the world (Align a car and sensors to the map).
- Use particle filters to localise the vehicle.
3. Control

- Fundamental concepts of robotic control.
- Build algorithms to steer car and wheels so as to meet an objective.

Term 3: Path Planning, Controlling a Self-Driving Car

Path Planning: Finding a sequence of steps in a maze (navigating cities, parking lots)
Put your code in a self-driving car
